# Demo

Run a simple implementation of this grid by cloning this repository and running:

```shell
cargo run --example simple
```

# Features

* Easily spawn an infinite grid aligned to the world origin and axes
* Spawn an unlimited number of axes aligned to arbitrary coordinate spaces

# Usage

Add the plugin to the `[dependencies]` in `Cargo.toml`

```toml
bevy_infinite_grid = { git = "https://github.com/ForesightMiningSoftwareCorporation/bevy_infinite_grid", branch = "main" }
```

Insert the infinite grid plugin after the default plugins.

```rust
.add_plugins(InfiniteGridPlugin)
```

And spawn the grid to see the results.

```rust
commands.spawn(InfiniteGridBundle::new(
    materials.add(InfiniteGridMaterial::default()),
));
```

See the [simple](examples/simple.rs) demo for an example of a minimal implementation.
